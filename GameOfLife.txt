The root process is responsible for (reading the input from the text OR to generate random numbers) to fill the universe. 
It then distributes the chunks of the universe to old_Universe of other processes using Scatterv method of MPI. 
All processes work in their chunk to generate the new_Universe. The boundary elements of the chunks have to be communicated with the neighbour processes. This is done using send and recv methods of MPI. 
For each generation the processes alter the old_Universe and new_Universe i.e in ith iteration old_Universe is read to generate new_Universe and in (i+1)th generation new_Universe is used to generate old_Universe. 
Finally when all the processes have done their work the Root process gathers chunks from other processes for the printing.
